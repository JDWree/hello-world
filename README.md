# hello-world

Hi there!

My name is Jonatan De Wree. I am new to GitHub and am currently following its user guide.
Creating this change to the README.md file as an exercise on creating branches and commiting.
I am educating myself in programming with Python and Machine Learning. Let's keep on learning!

Cheers
Jonatan
